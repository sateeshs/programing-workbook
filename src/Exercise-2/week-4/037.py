## Month Name to Number of Days
'''The length of a month varies from 28 to 31 days. In this exercise you will create
a program that reads the name of a month from the user as a string. Then your
program should display the number of days in that month. Display “28 or 29 days”
for February so that leap years are addressed.'''
