## Name That Shape
'''Write a program that determines the name of a shape from its number of sides. Read
the number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of
a meaningful message. Your program should support shapes with anywhere from 3
up to (and including) 10 sides. If a number of sides outside of this range is entered
then your program should display an appropriate error message.'''
