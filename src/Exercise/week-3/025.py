# When is Easter?
'''Easter is celebrated on the Sunday immediately after the first full moon following the
spring equinox. Because its date includes a lunar component, Easter does not have
a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar. Instead, it can occur on any date between March 22 and April 25. The month and day for Easter can be computed for a given
year using the Anonymous Gregorian Computus algorithm, which is shown below.'''
