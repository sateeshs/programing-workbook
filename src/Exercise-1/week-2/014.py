## Area and Volume
'''Write a program that begins by reading a radius, r , from the user. The program will
continue by computing and displaying the area of a circle with radius r and the
volume of a sphere with radius r . Use the pi constant in the math module in your
calculations.
##Hint:Hint: The area of a circle is computed using the formula area = πr 2 . The
volume of a sphere is computed using the formula volume = 43 πr 3 .'''
