    "#Area of a Triangle (Again)\n",
    "In the previous exercise you created a program that computed the area of a triangle\n",
    "when the length of its base and its height were known. It is also possible to compute\n",
    "the area of a triangle when the lengths of all three sides are known. Let s1 , s2 and s3\n",
    "be the lengths of the sides. Let $$s = (s1 + s2 + s3 )/2$$. Then the area of the triangle\n",
    "can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "---\n",
    "$$\n",
    "area =  \\sqrt{s × (s − s1 ) × (s − s2 ) × (s − s3 )}\n",

    "Develop a program that reads the lengths of the sides of a triangle from the user and\n",
