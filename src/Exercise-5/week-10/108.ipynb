Each integer identifies a specific element in the list, and is referred to as the index for that element.

    "### An individual list element can be updated using an assignment statement. The name of the list, followed by the element’s index enclosed in square brackets, appears to the left of the assignment operator. The new value that will be stored at that index appears to the assignment operator’s right. When the assignment statement executes, the element previously stored at the indicated index is overwritten with the new value. The other elements in the list are not impacted by this change. Consider the following example. It creates a list that contains four elements, and then it replaces the element at index 2 with 2.30. When the print statement executes it will display all of the values in the list. Those values are 2.71, 3.14, 2.30 and 1.62.\n",
