    "#### This program begins by initializing _data_ and _total_ to the values shown. Then the for loop begins to execute. The first value in _data_ is copied into _value_ and then the body of the loop runs. It adds _value_ to the total. Once the body of the loop has executed for the first time control returns to the top of the loop. The second element in _data_ is copied into _value_, and the loop body executes again which adds this new value to the _total_. This process continues until the While loops can also be used when working with lists. For example, the following code segment uses a while loop to identify the index of the first positive value in a list. The loop uses a variable, i, which holds the indices of the elements in the list, starting from 0. The value in i increases as the program runs until either the end of the list is reached or a positive element is found."
