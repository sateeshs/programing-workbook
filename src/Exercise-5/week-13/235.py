# Generate All Sublists of a List
# (Solved, 41 Lines)
'''Using the definition of a sublist from Exercise 133, write a function that returns a
list containing every possible sublist of a list. For example, the sublists of [1, 2,
3] are [], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3] and [1, 2, 3]. Note that your
function will always return a list containing at least the empty list because the empty
list is a sublist of every list. Include a main program that demonstrate your function
by displaying all of the sublists of several different lists.'''
