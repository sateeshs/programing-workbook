# Is a List already in Sorted Order?
# (41 Lines)
'''Write a function that determines whether or not a list of values is in sorted order
(either ascending or descending). The function should return True if the list is
already sorted. Otherwise it should return False. Write a main program that reads
a list of numbers from the user and then uses your function to report whether or not
the list is sorted

Make sure you consider these questions when completing this exercise: Is a
list that is empty in sorted order? What about a list containing one element?
